# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 12, 2026

At SecurePixel, we prioritize the security of your data. This policy outlines how we handle information.

## 1. The Encryption Process (Client-Side)
All image encryption and decryption happen **locally on your device** (Client-Side) using the Web Crypto API. 
- We do **not** have access to your original images.
- We do **not** have access to your passwords.
- We do **not** store your encryption keys.

## 2. Analytics & Tracking
We use **Google Analytics** to understand how visitors interact with our website (e.g., page views, session duration, device type). 
- This data is collected anonymously.
- Google Analytics creates a cookie to distinguish unique users.
- You can opt-out by using browser extensions like "uBlock Origin" or "Google Analytics Opt-out Add-on."

## 3. External Services
- **ImgBB:** If you choose to use the "Auto-Upload" feature, your *encrypted* image (the visual noise) is uploaded to ImgBB. Please refer to [ImgBB's Privacy Policy](https://imgbb.com/privacy) for how they handle hosted files.
